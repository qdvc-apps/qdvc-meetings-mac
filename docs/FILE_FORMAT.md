# Workspace File Format

A QDVC Meetings workspace is an ordinary folder of small YAML files. Nothing
is kept in a database, so a workspace can be versioned with Git, synced with
Syncthing or iCloud Drive, searched with `grep`, and edited by hand. This
document is the reference for the format; `MeetingsCore` implements it and
its tests check it.

---

## 1. Layout

```
(workspace root)/
    meetings/<yyyy>/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<hhmm>-<title-slug>.yml   one meeting per file
    platforms.yml                                        platform instructions (optional)
```

- A folder counts as a workspace if it contains `meetings/`. Opening any
  other folder (after confirmation) creates `meetings/`.
- Every `*.yml` or `*.yaml` file anywhere under `meetings/` is a meeting,
  whatever its name or folder. Hidden files and folders (names starting
  with `.`) are ignored, so sync-tool folders such as Syncthing's
  `.stversions` do not create phantom meetings.
- Files are written atomically and immediately. Encoding is UTF-8 with `\n`
  line endings.

## 2. File names

Every name the app makes uses only lower-case `a–z`, digits `0–9` and `-`,
with `/` between folders and the `.yml` extension:

```
meetings/2026/2026-10-05-1400-budget-review.yml
```

- The folder is the meeting's year, `meetings/<yyyy>`.
- The stem is `<yyyy-mm-dd>-<hhmm>-<title-slug>`, at most 56 characters.
- If the name is taken, `-2`, `-3`… is added: `…-budget-review-2.yml`.
- The file is renamed (and moved to another year folder) when the meeting's
  date, time or title changes, so the folder reads as a chronological log.
  A name that differs only by its collision suffix is left alone. A year
  folder left empty by a move or a deletion is removed.
- The name is only a convenience: the app never reads anything from it. A
  file you name yourself is read, and keeps its name until you change the
  meeting's date, time or title in the app.

### 2.1 The title slug

1. Lower-case the title; replace `&` with " and " and `@` with " at ".
2. Remove apostrophes and backticks (`'`, `’`, `‘`, `` ` ``), so "Bob's"
   becomes "bobs".
3. Replace letters that have no accent-free form: `ß`→`ss`, `æ`→`ae`,
   `œ`→`oe`, `ø`→`o`, `ł`→`l`, `đ`/`ð`→`d`, `þ`→`th`, `ı`→`i`, `ħ`→`h`,
   `ŋ`→`n`, `ſ`→`s`. Then remove accents (`é`→`e`, `ü`→`u`).
4. Turn every run of characters other than `a–z` and `0–9` into a single
   `-`, and trim `-` from both ends.
5. If the result is longer than 40 characters, cut it at 40; if that cut
   falls inside a word, cut instead at the last `-` that keeps at least 20
   characters. Trim `-` again.
6. If nothing is left (for example a title in a non-Latin script), use
   `meeting`.

| Title | Slug |
| --- | --- |
| `Budget review` | `budget-review` |
| `Supplier call: Ørsted & Co` | `supplier-call-orsted-and-co` |
| `Bob's 1:1` | `bobs-1-1` |
| `Café catch-up` | `cafe-catch-up` |
| `Quarterly planning workshop for the regional operations leadership team` | `quarterly-planning-workshop-for-the` |
| `会议` | `meeting` |

Export file names use the same slug: `yyyy-mm-dd-<title-slug>-notes.docx`
(or `.md`).

## 3. Meeting files

```yaml

```

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | no | One line. Missing or empty reads as "Untitled Meeting". |
| `date` | `yyyy-mm-dd` | **yes** | A calendar day with no time zone. |
| `time` | `HH:MM` | **yes** | Wall-clock start time, 24-hour. `H:MM` and `HH:MM:SS` are also read. |
| `end_time` | `HH:MM` | no | Wall-clock end time on the same day. |
| `location` | string | no | One line: free text, or a link (§3.1). |
| `people` | list of strings | no | Names (§3.2). A single string reads as a one-item list. |
| `description` | string | no | Any number of lines. |
| `notes` | list | no | §3.3. |

- **Times have no time zone**, as in a paper diary: a 14:00 meeting stays at
  14:00 wherever you are. They are written single-quoted (`'14:00'`)
  because YAML 1.1 readers such as PyYAML would read a bare `14:00` as the
  number 840. Bare times are read correctly here, since every scalar is
  read as the text written.
- **Key order** on write: the order in the table, then any other keys in
  the order they were read. Empty optional keys are left out.
- **Unknown keys are kept.** A key this version does not know (at the top
  level or in a note) is written back unchanged, so a hand edit or a future
  version's field survives a save. Its value keeps its content but not
  necessarily its layout: a flow-style list `[1, 2]` comes back in block
  style.
- **Strings** are written plain where that reads back as the same string,
  single-quoted where a plain scalar would read as something else
  (`'yes'`, `'123'`, or text containing `: `), and as a literal block
  (`|-`) when they have several lines. Trailing spaces and newlines are
  trimmed.
- **A file that cannot be read** (not YAML, not a mapping, or no usable
  `date` or `time`) is left untouched and named in a banner above the
  meetings, with Reveal in Finder.

### 3.1 Location kinds

The kind is worked out from the text each time it is shown, never stored.
Matching is case-insensitive, on the URL's scheme and host, after trimming
spaces; text containing spaces is never a link.

| Kind | Rule | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Teams | `https` URL whose host contains `teams` and, later, `microsoft` (the `https://*teams*microsoft*/` pattern) | `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/…` |
| Zoom | `https` URL whose host contains `zoom` (`https://*zoom*/`) | `https://us02web.zoom.us/j/…` |
| Google Maps | `https` URL with host `maps.google.*`, `maps.app.goo.gl`, `google.*` and a path starting `/maps`, or `goo.gl` and a path starting `/maps` (a leading `www.` is ignored) | `https://maps.app.goo.gl/AbC123` |
| Other link | any other `http` or `https` URL | `https://example.com/room` |
| Free text | anything else | `Room 4.12` |

### 3.2 People

A person is a name. Names are compared ignoring case and extra spaces, so
`alice  SMITH` and `Alice Smith` are one person. On write, names are
trimmed, runs of spaces are collapsed and later duplicates are removed.
There is no separate file of people: the app derives the list from every
meeting's `people` and every action item's `assignees` each time it loads,
showing each person under their most common spelling.

### 3.3 Notes

Each item in `notes` is a mapping:

| Key | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | string | Any number of lines. Notes with no text are not written. |
| `kind` | `action` or `decision` | Omitted for a plain note. On read, `action item`, `action_item`, `todo` and `task` also mean `action`, and `decided` means `decision`; anything else is a plain note. |
| `assignees` | list of strings | People assigned to an action item. |

- Notes are kept in the order written; the app's drag and drop and Move
  Up / Move Down change that order.
- `assignees` are kept on a note that is not an action item (so turning an
  action item into a decision and back loses nothing), but are only shown,
  searched, counted and exported for action items.
- A plain string in the list reads as a plain note with that text.

## 4. `platforms.yml`

Short instructions shown as a callout on every meeting on that platform:

```yaml
teams: Use the Teams desktop app and sign in with your work account.
zoom: 'Join from the Zoom app with SSO (company domain: example).'
```

- Keys `teams` and `zoom`; empty ones are left out, and other keys are
  kept. A file with no instructions is written as `{}`.
- The file is optional; a missing file means no callouts. About 200
  characters (two sentences) fit the callout well; longer text is allowed.
- Edited in Settings → Platforms, and written when you leave each field.
